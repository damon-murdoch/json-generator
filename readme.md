# json-generator
## A Web Application for converting JavaScript Objects to Json Objects.
### Developed by Damon Murdoch ([@SirScrubbington](https://twitter.com/SirScrubbington)).

## Introduction
This application is a web application (written in html/javascript) which

This is useful for converting JavaScript objects to a format which allows 
to them to be used by other applications.
